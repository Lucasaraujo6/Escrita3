abstract = {The data article describes a real operational dataset for the Concrete Delivery Problem (CDP). The dataset consists of 263 instances corresponding to daily orders of concrete from construction sites in Quebec, Canada. A concrete producer, i.e., a concrete-producing company that delivers concrete, provided the raw data. We cleaned the data by removing entries corresponding to non-complete orders. We processed these raw data to form instances useful for benchmarking optimization algorithms developed to solve the CDP. We also anonymized the published dataset by removing any client information and addresses corresponding to production or construction sites. The dataset is useful for researchers and practitioners studying the CDP. It can be processed to create artificial data for variations of the CDP. In its current form, the data contain information about intra-day orders. Thus, selected instances from the dataset are useful for CDP's dynamic aspect considering real-time orders.}

We consider a special case of the problem which can be solved in polinomial time by a minimum cost flow algorithm. Based on this approach we develop a heuristic procedure for the general case. Comparisons with an exact graph-based method attest that our heuristic produces good-quality solutions in short running times.}

But no work has gathered this information to facilitate the comprehensive study of the CDP and investigate the research paths taken until today. Using a systematic search and mapping review, this paper fills that gap by (a) performing a comprehensive search on the CDP, and (b) mapping out and categorizing the existing literature. Specifically, this paper provides an overview of the various methods of the literature, categorizing the problem formulations based on the literature's different concepts, i.e., Integer Programming (IP), Time-Space Network, and the Job Shop model. The consistency between industry needs and existing constraints was discussed, and insights into the data sets corresponding to real-world cases were provided, identifying the necessary data for practitioners.}

abstract = {The coordination of just-in-time production and transportation in a network of partially independent facilities to guarantee timely delivery to distributed customers is one of the most challenging aspect of supply chain management. From a theoretical perspective, the timely production/distribution can be viewed as a hybrid combination of planning, scheduling and routing problems, each notoriously affected by nearly prohibitive combinatorial complexity. From a practical viewpoint, the problem calls for a trade-off between risks and profits. This paper focuses on the ready-mixed concrete delivery: in addition to the mentioned complexity, strict time-constraints forbid both earliness and lateness of the supply. After developing a detailed model of the considered problem, we propose a novel meta-heuristic approach based on a hybrid genetic algorithm combined with constructive heuristics. A detailed case study derived from industrial data is used to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach.}

We give a general mixed integer programming model which is too hard to solve for state of the art mixed integer programming optimizers in the case of the usually huge problem instances coming from practice. Therefore we present a certain local search approach to be able to handle huge practical problem instances.}

The distribution of ready-mixed concrete (RMC) is a highly complex problem in logistics and combinatorial optimization. This paper proposes two hybrid solution procedures for dealing with this problem. They are based on a combination of an exact algorithm and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) approach. The VNS is used at first to generate feasible solutions and is trying to further improve them. The exact method is based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, which is solved (after an appropriated variable fixing phase) by using a general-purpose MILP solver. An approach based on very large neighborhood search (VLNS) determines which variables are supposed to be fixed. In a sense, the approaches follows a local branching scheme. The hybrid metaheuristics are compared with the pure VNS approach and the conclusion is that the new metaheuristics outperform the VNS if applied solely.}

This investigation divides factors that affect truck dispatching of RMC plants into intrinsic and imposed constraints, where intrinsic constraints refer to limits that must be satisfied during the concrete distribution process; imposed constraints are those that should be fulfilled to the greatest extent possible during dispatching. The results will help concrete plant dispatchers of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) determine a cost effective and reliable day-to-day distribution scheme and achieve better customer service. This work contributes to both modeling and dispatching operations of RMC trucks as a job shop problem by applying optimization tools that enable RMC SMEs to detect and subsequently take advantage of opportunities that may exist for improving daily operation efficiency.}

Finally, the model and solution method are evaluated by performing a case study. The test results show that, with the application of the model and the solution algorithm, mixer breakdowns do not lead to much deterioration in the system operating performance. In addition, the system operating cost is significantly improved (by 10.75 %) compared to that obtained using the manual approach. As a result, the model and the solution algorithm could be useful for actual operations.}

abstract = {From an operational point of view, Ready-Mixed Concrete Suppliers are faced with challenging operational problems such as the acquisition of raw materials, scheduling of production facilities, and the transportation of concrete. This paper is centered around the logistical and distributional part of the operation: the scheduling and routing of concrete, commonly known as the Concrete Delivery Problem (CDP). The problem aims at finding efficient routes for a fleet of (heterogeneous) vehicles, alternating between concrete production centers and construction sites, and adhering to strict scheduling and routing constraints. Thus far, a variety of CDPs and solution approaches have appeared in academic research. However, variations in problem definitions and the lack of publicly available benchmark data inhibit a mutual comparison of these approaches. Therefore, this work presents a more fundamental version of CDP, while preserving the main characteristics of the existing problem variations. Both exact and heuristic algorithms for CDP are proposed. The exact solution approaches include a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and a Constraint Programming model. Similarly, two heuristics are studied: the first heuristic relies on an efficient best-fit scheduling procedure, whereas the second heuristic utilizes the MIP model to improve delivery schedules locally. Computational experiments are conducted on new, publicly accessible, data sets; results are compared against lower bounds on the optimal solutions.}

A network flow method is applied to formulate the integrated scheduling problem of ready-mixed concrete production and delivery with trucks and pumps, where the demands of construction sites are in certain time windows. A method is developed that applies a genetic algorithm in which the chromosome consists of three sequences (construction sites, delivery order and vehicle IDs); operators work on the sequences of construction sites. The approach is evaluated by simulation of real cases. Comparison with combinations of other priority rules for scheduling production and vehicles demonstrates the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm. Sensitivity analysis reveals the effects of the fleet size of an available vehicle, the cost rates and the time windows of construction sites. The model and algorithm may be helpful for practical integrated operations for operation management at RMC plants.}

In addition, the concrete delivery dispatching problem can be modelled mathematically but it can only solve up to medium sizes of this problem within a practical time. This paper attempts to answer the question of how much we can rely on experts' decisions. First, the concrete delivery problem is presented. Second, a benchmark for the problem is achieved; two heuristic methods are used for those instances that their exact solutions are not available. Finally, the experts' decisions are compared with the obtained benchmarks to assess the optimality gap of the experts. A field dataset which belongs to an active Ready Mixed Concrete (RMC) is used to evaluate the proposed idea. The results show that experts' decisions are near to optimum, with an average accuracy of 90%. However, after comparing individual decisions between optimisation models and the experts' decisions, we can conclude that optimisation models only try to achieve the lowest cost, while the expert prefers a more stable dispatching system at slightly higher cost.}

A heuristic algorithm with eight sets of conjoint priority rules for production scheduling, truck and pump dispatching, and mixer scheduling is developed to solve the problem. Computational experiments are conducted on actual cases collected from an RMC company; these cases are classified into four types based on the quantity of orders from construction sites and the discrete degree of construction sites. The advantages and disadvantages of adopting various conjoint-rules in the various types of cases are determined.
